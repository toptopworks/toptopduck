//! [`super::engine`] (ACP path), [`super::probe`], and
//! [`super::app_server`] spawn their CLI child through [`spawn_piped`] here,
//! while [`super::json_event_stream`] (codex native exec path) keeps its own

/// watchdog. Poll `try_wait` under this grace instead: on POSIX the kill is
/// delivered immediately (SIGKILL) so the agent is normally reaped on the first
/// poll, and a wedged reap cannot hang the turn — on POSIX the resulting

/// the spawn shape (env, cwd, stdio wiring) lands in one place, not three.
/// The codex native exec spawn ([`super::json_event_stream`]) is deliberately
